JRI_Library_Management_System
=============================

Simple library management system for Jose Rizal Institute.

This is written entirely in Visual Basic. Feel free to use and modify the system. I used Microsoft access as back end.
Open the database to see the password to login in the system.
I also used third party plugin for the design which is the CloudToolkit. 

Note:
The system was created using Visual Studio Ultimate 2013, so the project will not run on lower version of Visual Studio.
You can run the system on Express edition of visual studio 2013.
